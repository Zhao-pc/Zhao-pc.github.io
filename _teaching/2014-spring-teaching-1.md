Sensors are measuring devices that directly sense the measured quantity using sensitive elements and convert it into usable electrical signals. They are considered the origin of information technology and serve as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. Sensors hold significant positions in numerous fields such as aerospace, petrochemicals, vehicles and ships, energy and power, food and environmental protection, and medical health. Mastering sensor technology and employing sensors reasonably are essential skills for engineering and technical professionals. Let's embark on a personalized journey of sensor technology and applications by learning together in the course "Sensor Technology and Applications"!

传感器是利用敏感元件直接感受被测量，并转换为可用电信号的测量装置，被认为是信息技术的源头、物理世界和数字世界的桥梁；在航空航天、石油化工、车辆船舶、能源动力、食品环保、医疗健康等众多领域具有重要地位。 掌握传感器技术，合理使用传感器是工程技术人员的基本素养。让我们一起学习“传感器技术及应用”，走过一段个性化的传感器之旅！
