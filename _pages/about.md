I am **Zhao Pengcheng**, currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), collaborating with [Prof. Jin Wei](https://jinwei-group.github.io/group_website/author/wei-jin/) and [Prof. Zhang Aping](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/researchgrp/azhang/index.htm). I received my Ph.D. from Beihang University (BUAA) in 2022 and B.S. from Jilin University (JLU) in 2015. Throughout my academic career, I was the recipient of numerous national scholarships and awards, including **Humboldt Research Fellowship** for Postdocs (2024/07), the **Best Oral Presentation Awards of OFS-China 2024**, "**_China’s Top 10 Optical Breakthrough in 2020_**" (In the News: [Chinese Laser Press](https://www.opticsjournal.net/columns/zggx?type=view&postid=PT21042600003LiOkR), [PolyU](https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/prizes/2020%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%85%89%E5%AD%A6%E5%8D%81%E5%A4%A7%E8%BF%9B%E5%B1%95-chinas-top-10-optical-breakthroughs-in-optics)), and the **Excellent Doctoral Thesis Award** of Beijing as well as BUAA in 2023. I will be joining the Department of Fiber Photonics at IPHT, led by [Prof. Dr. Markus Schmidt](https://www.leibniz-ipht.de/en/departments/fiber-photonics/), this November.

My research interests mainly focus on laser spectroscopy, ﬁber-optic sensors and devices. I’ve participated in 4 research grants, published 10 peer-reviewed papers such as **_Nature Communications_**, **_Laser & Photonics Reviews_** (2023,2024), **_Photoacoustics_** and **_Optics Letters_**, and co-authored 3 national patents. I also serve as a reviewer for international journals such as _Opt. Laser Technol._ and _Sens. Actuators, A_.
