I am **Zhao Pengcheng**, a **Humboldt Fellow (洪堡学者)** at the Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology (德国莱布尼兹光子技术研究所) in Germany, currently working in the Department of Fiber Photonics led by [Prof. Markus Schmidt](https://www.leibniz-ipht.de/en/departments/fiber-photonics/). Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), collaborating with [Prof. Jin Wei](https://jinwei-group.github.io/group_website/author/wei-jin/) and [Prof. Zhang Aping](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/researchgrp/azhang/index.htm). I received my Ph.D. from Beihang University (BUAA) in 2022 and my B.S. from Jilin University (JLU) in 2015. Throughout my academic career, I have received numerous fellowships/scholarships and awards, including [Humboldt Research Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/connect/explore-the-humboldt-network/singleview/1240498/dr-pengcheng-zhao), ["China’s Top 10 Optical Breakthroughs in 2020（2020年中国光学十大进展）"](https://www.opticsjournal.net/columns/zggx?type=view&postid=PT21042600003LiOkR), [Best Oral Presentation Award](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vHMugK28tNrUqEpGskSMDQ) at OFS-China 2024, and the Excellent Doctoral Thesis Awards of both Beijing and BUAA.

My research interests include laser spectroscopy, fiber-optic sensors, and fiber-optic devices. I have participated in four research grants, published over 10 peer-reviewed papers in journals such as **_Nature Communications_**, **_Laser & Photonics Reviews_** (2023, 2024), **_Photoacoustics_**, and **_Optics Letters_**, and co-authored three national patents. I also serve as a reviewer for international journals including _Optics & Laser Technology_ and _Sensors & Actuators A: Physical_.
