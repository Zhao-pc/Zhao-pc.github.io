I am Zhao Pengcheng (赵鹏程), currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), in collaboration with Prof. Jin Wei and Prof. Zhang Aping. I received my Ph.D. in Engineering from Beihang University (BUAA) in 2022 and and B.S. in Engineering from Jilin University (JLU) in 2015. Throughout my academic career, I was the recipient of numerous national scholarships and awards, including "_China’s Top 10 Optical Breakthrough in 2020_".

My research interests mainly focus on laser spectroscopy, ﬁber-optic sensors and devices. I’ve participated in 4 research grants, published 10 peer-reviewed papers such as _Nature Communications_, _Laser & Photonics Reviews_, and _Optics Letters_, and co-authored 3 national patents.
