I am Zhao Pengcheng (赵鹏程), currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), in collaboration with Prof. Jin Wei and Prof. Zhang Aping. I received my Ph.D. in Engineering from Beihang University (BUAA) in 2022 and B.S. in Engineering from Jilin University (JLU) in 2015. Throughout my academic career, I was the recipient of numerous national scholarships and awards, including "_China’s Top 10 Optical Breakthrough in 2020_" (In the News: [Chinese Laser Press](https://www.opticsjournal.net/columns/zggx?type=view&postid=PT21042600003LiOkR), [PolyU](https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/prizes/2020%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%85%89%E5%AD%A6%E5%8D%81%E5%A4%A7%E8%BF%9B%E5%B1%95-chinas-top-10-optical-breakthroughs-in-optics)).

My research interests mainly focus on laser spectroscopy, ﬁber-optic sensors and devices. I’ve participated in 4 research grants, published 10 peer-reviewed papers such as _Nature Communications_, _Laser & Photonics Reviews_, and _Optics Letters_, and co-authored 3 national patents. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me via [Email](mailto:zhaopc@buaa.edu.cn).
